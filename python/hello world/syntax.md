Args and Kwargs[
    *args and **kwargs allow you to pass an undefined number of arguments and keywords when calling a function.

        >>> def some_function(*args, **kwargs):
        ...     pass
        ...
        >>> # call some_function with any number of arguments
        >>> some_function(arg1, arg2, arg3)

        >>> # call some_function with any number of keywords
        >>> some_function(key1=arg1, key2=arg2, key3=arg3)

        >>> # call both, arguments and keywords
        >>> some_function(arg, key1=arg1)

        >>> # or none
        >>> some_function()
    Python conventions The words *args and **kwargs are conventions. They are not imposed by the interpreter, but considered good practice by the Python community.

args[
    You can access the arguments through the args variable:

        >>> def some_function(*args):
        ...     print(f'Arguments passed: {args} as {type(args)}')
        ...
        >>> some_function('arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3')
        # Arguments passed: ('arg1', 'arg2', 'arg3') as <class 'tuple'>
]
kwargs[
    Keywords are accessed through the kwargs variable:

        >>> def some_function(**kwargs):
        ...     print(f'keywords: {kwargs} as {type(kwargs)}')
        ...
        >>> some_function(key1='arg1', key2='arg2')
        # keywords: {'key1': 'arg1', 'key2': 'arg2'} as <class 'dict'>
]
//
Operators[
    Exponent: ** Ex 2 ** 3 = 8
    Modulus/Remainder: % Ex 22 % 8 = 6
    Integer Division: // Ex 22 // 8 = 2
    Division: / Ex 22 / 8 = 2.75
    Multiplication: * Ex 3 * 3 = 9
    Subtraction: - Ex 5 - 2 = 3
    Addition: + Ex 2 + 2 = 4

Augmented Assignment Operators[
    Operator	Equivalent
    var += 1	var = var + 1
    var -= 1	var = var - 1
    var *= 1	var = var * 1
    var /= 1	var = var / 1
    var %= 1	var = var % 1

    //////

    Examples:
    greeting = 'Hello'
    greeting += ' world!'
    greeting
    #'Hello world!'

    number = 1
    number += 1
    number
    # 2

    my_list = ['item']
    my_list *= 3
    my_list
    # ['item', 'item', 'item']

Data Types[
    Data Type	                    Examples
    Integers	              -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
    Floating-point numbers	    -1.25, -1.0, --0.5, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.25
    Strings	                  'a', 'aa', 'aaa', 'Hello!', '11 cats'
    ]
Concatenation and Replication[
    String concatenation:

    'Alice' 'Bob'
    # 'AliceBob'

    String replication:

    'Alice' * 5
    # 'AliceAliceAliceAliceAlice'
]
Variables[
    You can name a variable anything as long as it obeys the following rules:

    It can be only one word.
        # bad
        my variable = 'Hello'

        # good
        var = 'Hello'
    It can use only letters, numbers, and the underscore (_) character.
        # bad
        %$@variable = 'Hello'

        # good
        my_var = 'Hello'

        # good
        my_var_2 = 'Hello'
    It canâ€™t begin with a number.
        # this wont work
        23_var = 'hello'
    Variable name starting with an underscore (_) are considered as "unuseful"
        # _spam should not be used again in the code
        _spam = 'Hello'
]
Comments[
    Inline comment:

        # This is a comment
        Multiline comment:

        # This is a
        # multiline comment
        Code with a comment:

        a = 1  # initialization
        Please note the two spaces in front of the comment.

    Function docstring:
    def foo():
        """
        This is a function docstring
        You can also use:
        ''' Function Docstring '''
        """
]
The print() Function[
    The print() function writes the value of the argument(s) it is given. [...] it handles multiple arguments, floating point-quantities, and strings. Strings are printed without quotes, and a space is inserted between items, so you can format things nicely:

         print('Hello world!')
            # Hello world!

         a = 1
         print('Hello world!', a)
         # Hello world! 1
]
The end keyword[
    The keyword argument end can be used to avoid the newline after the output, or end the output with a different string:

        phrase = ['printed', 'with', 'a', 'dash', 'in', 'between']
        >>> for word in phrase:
        ...     print(word, end='-')
        ...
        # printed-with-a-dash-in-between-
]
The sep keyword[
    The keyword sep specify how to separate the objects, if there is more than one:

    print('cats', 'dogs', 'mice', sep=',')
    # cats,dogs,mice
]
The input() Function[
    This function takes the input from the user and converts it into a string:

        >>> print('What is your name?')   # ask for their name
        >>> my_name = input()
        >>> print('Hi, {}'.format(my_name))
        # What is your name?
        # Martha
        # Hi, Martha
    input() can also set a default message without using print():

        >>> my_name = input('What is your name? ')  # default message
        >>> print('Hi, {}'.format(my_name))
        # What is your name? Martha
        # Hi, Martha
    It is also possible to use formatted strings to avoid using .format:

        >>> my_name = input('What is your name? ')  # default message
        >>> print(f'Hi, {my_name}')
        # What is your name? Martha
        # Hi, Martha
]
The len() Function[
    Evaluates to the integer value of the number of characters in a string, list, dictionary, etc.:

        >>> len('hello')
        # 5

        >>> len(['cat', 3, 'dog'])
        # 3
    Test of emptiness Test of emptiness of strings, lists, dictionaries, etc., should not use len, but prefer direct boolean evaluation.
    Test of emptiness example:

        >>> a = [1, 2, 3]

        # bad
        >>> if len(a) > 0:  # evaluates to True
        ...     print("the list is not empty!")
        ...
        # the list is not empty!

        # good
        >>> if a: # evaluates to True
        ...     print("the list is not empty!")
        ...
        # the list is not empty!
]
The str(), int(), and float() Functions[
    These functions allow you to change the type of variable. For example, you can transform from an integer or float to a string:

        >>> str(29)
        # '29'

        >>> str(-3.14)
        # '-3.14'
        Or from a string to an integer or float:

        >>> int('11')
        # 11

        >>> float('3.14')
        # 3.14
